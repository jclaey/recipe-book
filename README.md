# recipe-book
A Node.js RESTful web application that follows an MVC architecture pattern and allows users to sign up, jot down their favorite recipes, and save them to the application using MongoDB. The application uses Express as its backend framework and Mongoose for modeling its resources and working with the database. In addition, Passport is used for authentication, BCrypt for encrypting passwords, and Handlebars for templating.
